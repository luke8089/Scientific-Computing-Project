# Assignment 1: Scientific Computing with Python

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 1 from the Scientific Computing course. The assignment is divided into four tasks:

1. **Task (a):** Plotting a line graph for temperature readings over a week.
2. **Task (b):** Generating an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 with a common difference of 3 for 8 terms.
3. **Task (c):** Calculating the volume under the surface **z = x² + y²** over the square region 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1.
4. **Task (d):** Explaining the differences between compiled and interpreted programming languages with an emphasis on scientific computing, including examples of interpreted languages such as Python.

## File Structure
- `assignment1.py`  
  Contains the Python code for tasks (a) through (c).

- `README.md`  
  Provides an overview of the assignment, instructions for running the code, and details about each task.

- `report.docx` (or similar)  
  A document where the GitHub repository link is pasted along with the explanation for task (d).  
  *(If required by your submission guidelines.)*

## Instructions
